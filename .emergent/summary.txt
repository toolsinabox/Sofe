**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Theming with Tailwind CSS:** The entire redesign was achieved by systematically replacing dark-theme CSS utility classes (, ) with light-theme equivalents (, , ).
-   **UI Compaction:** Improving data density by reducing padding ( -> ), font sizes ( -> ), grid gaps ( -> ), and increasing grid columns ( -> ).
-   **Parallel File Operations:** Used  and chained  commands to efficiently update numerous files with similar style changes simultaneously.

**key DB schema**
-   No schema changes were made in this session.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/merchant/MerchantAddons.jsx**: Newly created file for the addons feature.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/merchant/***: Nearly all files in this directory were modified to apply the new light theme and compact design. Key examples include , , , and .
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/layout/MerchantSidebar.jsx**: The central navigation, styled with a dark background.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/merchant/MerchantLayout.jsx**: The main layout component defining the dark-sidebar/light-content structure.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/merchant/MerchantShipping.jsx**: The  is still an inline component and must be extracted to improve stability and maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   No new or modified API endpoints in this session.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Top Priority:** The user has provided new feature requests. You must first implement the Addons page (add a route, sidebar link, and UI) and then enhance the product information page based on the Maropost screenshot.
-   **UI is Complete but Malleable:** The backend UI redesign and compaction tasks are complete. The user is happy with the result but may have further minor adjustment requests. Be prepared to make small tweaks to the new compact design.
-   **Recurring Technical Debt:** The  extraction in  has been pending for multiple sessions. It is a known cause of UI instability and should be addressed soon to improve the robustness of the shipping module.

**documents and test_reports created in this job**
-   None.
